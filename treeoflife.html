    CSCI 2408 Computer Graphics Fall 2022 
    (c)2022 by Ayan Hashimova, Amina Shikhaliyeva, Sadiq Latifli, Sevinj Aliyeva
    Submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements of the course.

    Contributions:
    Ayan Hashimova - 40% - implemented tree structure, webGL display of the tree, perspective/camera view, found normals,
                          accordingly implemented directional lighting and transformations, and added ground structure
    Amina Shikhaliyeva - 30% - did sunrise sunset, kept track and definition of faces, worked on directional lighting,
                            did fps camera, worked on randomizer of seed, assisted Ayan Hashimova in camera view
    Sadig Latifli - 20% - documented code, did randomizer of seed, worked with rotation of the tree, filmed demo video
    Sevinj Aliyeva - 10% - did research and joined discussions
